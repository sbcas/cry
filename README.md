# cry

    Get ready to cry your way to a better Bluetooth experience

## Requisites
* A [Linux](https://www.kernel.org) distribution. Any old
  [thang](https://distrowatch.com) will do.
* sudo - if you're not using Ubuntu or something that comes with it
  preinstalled, y'all can probably get along with some other means of privilege
  escalation. It's open source, you do you, boo.

### Alright, how do we get started?

Real simple, friends. Y'all can move this around somewhere, or just execute it
from the place you cloned it, right here.

When you power on your device and your host doesn't handshake, or if you get
that hollow airplane audio, just `cry`, and `cry` some more until it connects,
or you have to reboot. Sometimes, I have to have a good `cry` four or five
times in a row before my headset connects, but it depends on the time of day.

PRs welcome to help improve the crying experience.
